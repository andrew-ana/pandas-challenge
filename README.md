## Key Findings

### The vast majority (84%) of players are male

    Unsurprisingly, male players make up the bulk of the players in this dataset. However, females spend about 10% more than males do. This suggests that a potential marketing campaign dedicated toward female players could yield substantial returns


### Over half (59%) of players are between 18 and 26

    Again, the demographic distribution follows conventional wisdom. Young adults are active gamers with more free time and more willingness to spend money on games.


### The everage number of purchases per player is 1.35

    Even the most prolific spenders have only purchased a handful of items. Under current conditions, acquiring first-time spenders may not be worth the lifetime value that they generate. Also, for a player to be listed in this dataset, they have to have at least one purchase.
    

## Limitations

Let's not forget what this dataset actually represents. This is not the set of all players, **only the purchases**. So we don't know:
* What fraction of players ever purchase
* What are Gender/Age demographics of *all* players -- do they match the purchasing dataset
* How long it takes to get someone to buy
* How and when these items were introduced
