    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### The vast majority (84%) of players are male\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unsurprisingly, male players make up the bulk of the players in this dataset. However, females spend about 10% more than males do. This suggests that a potential marketing campaign dedicated toward female players could yield substantial returns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Over half (59%) of players are between 18 and 26\n",
    "\n",
    "    Again, the demographic distribution follows conventional wisdom. Young adults are active gamers with more free time and more willingness to spend money on games.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The everage number of purchases per player is 1.35\n",
    "\n",
    "    Even the most prolific spenders have only purchased a handful of items. Under current conditions, acquiring first-time spenders may not be worth the lifetime value that they generate. Also, for a player to be listed in this dataset, they have to have at least one purchase.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's not forget what this dataset actually represents. This is not the set of all players, **only the purchases**. So we don't know:\n",
    "* What fraction of players ever purchase\n",
    "* What are Gender/Age demographics of *all* players -- do they match the purchasing dataset\n",
    "* How long it takes to get someone to buy\n",
    "* How and when these items were introduced\n"
